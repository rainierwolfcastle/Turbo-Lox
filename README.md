# Turbo Lox

Yet another implementation of clox from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) book.

## How to run

Open the project file in Xcode.

## Additions

- Basic list support. You can create a list of fixed size like this: `var a = [1,2,3];`. Getters and Setters work as you would expect i.e. `var i = a[0];`, `a[0] = 1;`
- Some new binary operators - modulo (%), bitwise and (&) and shift bits right (>>).
- Some new native maths functions - sqrt() and floor().
